### Project Background:

Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest retailer, is facing operational challenges in managing inventory efficiently across its thousands of stores worldwide. With fluctuating customer demand, promotions, and external factors like weather impacting sales, Walmart's operations team is under pressure to ensure optimal stock levels without overspending on excess inventory or losing sales due to stockouts.
To maintain a competitive edge and meet growing customer demands, Walmart aims to implement real-time demand forecasting by analyzing historical sales data. This process will involve understanding the influence of customer purchasing behavior, external factors like weather, and the effectiveness of promotions. The analysis will guide Walmart's inventory decisions, enabling them to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Problem Definition:

Walmart needs a data-driven inventory optimization solution that minimizes both stockouts and overstocking by forecasting demand based on past sales data. The goal is to develop a scalable approach that adjusts inventory levels dynamically using real-time insights from the analysis.
Key Questions for Stakeholders:

# Inventory Managers:
How can we improve inventory accuracy and ensure that stock levels match demand?
What factors are contributing to stockouts, and how can we address them?
# Store Managers:
How can we allocate inventory more efficiently across stores based on local demand patterns?
How do promotions and weather influence sales at different store locations?
# Marketing and Promotions Team:
What is the return on investment (ROI) for promotions, and how do they affect demand?

### How These Questions Help the Company:
Q1-Q3: Enable Walmart to predict and manage stockouts, optimize promotions, and understand how external factors impact sales. These insights help in better inventory planning and resource allocation.
Q4-Q6: Allow Walmart to optimize inventory for new stores, handle seasonal demand fluctuations, and prioritize high-demand products for peak seasons, ensuring stock availability at the right times.
Q7-Q10: Focus on profitability strategies for low-margin products, predictive modeling for future promotions, store-level customization of inventory, and data-driven strategies for future promotions, maximizing both revenue and customer satisfaction.
